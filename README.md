# BroodMinder DIY Hacks
DIY hacks for working with BroodMinder.com devices

This repo will serve as a place for open-source code that talks to BroodMinder (www.broodminder.com) devices. While the code here is not officaly supported by the BroodMinder company, the code repo is sanctioned by BroodMinder.

Working with BroodMinder devices requires a knowledge of BLE (Bluetooth Low Entergy) devices. BroodMinders broadcast BLE "beacons" every few seconds which contain the current readings from the device, such as tempreature, humidity and battery. Code in this repo, with the right hardware, can read those beacons, converting their data into useable measurements.

For hardware or software that each piece of code requries to work, see the top of each source code.
